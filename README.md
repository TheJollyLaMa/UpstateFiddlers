### Use Case

A fiddlehead lover hears about your page and navigates to the website.  They see the about page and an email address to contact you.
They navigate to the market and notice fiddleheads are in season!  Every day, you log your weight and snap a photo.  It goes up on 
the front end "Fiddle Market" so people can request it or a portion of it by email.

The next steps are:
    Deploy to your domain and customize it a little more with your domain email in the contact info
    Set up the database (everything you see here is just mock up data without a database linked to it)
    Hook up payment gateways with paypal, googlepay, applepay, stripe, etc

    ... and then crypto is where we can get much more creative.
